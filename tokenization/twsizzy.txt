We were both young when I first saw you. I close my eyes and the flashback starts. I'm standin' there. On a balcony in summer air. See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns. See you make your way through the crowd. And say, 'Hello.' Little did I know that you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles. And my daddy said, 'Stay away from Juliet.' And I was cryin' on the staircase. Beggin' you, 'Please don't go, ' and I said. Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run. You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess. It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'
